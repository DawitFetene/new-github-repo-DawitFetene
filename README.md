# new-github-repo-DawitFetene

This is my ***very first assignment*** :smile:. 

## Thought Process with Assignment
- Chose MIT license as this project has no code and I don't mind people using it so long as thye properly attribute   
- I created this readme in this formate because the assignment specifically said *In a Markdown Links to an external site. document within your new repository, explain the choices you made when setting up your repo (no right or wrong answers; I just want to know your thinking)*
- I used [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#supported-color-models) for the github flavored markdown and [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for a general markdown guide
