<p> This is my **first assignment** </p>  

## Thought Process with Assignment
- Chose MIT license as this project has no code and I don't mind people using it so long as thye properly attribute   
- I created this readme in this formate because the assignment specifically said *In a Markdown Links to an external site. document within your new repository, explain the choices you made when setting up your repo (no right or wrong answers; I just want to know your thinking)*
